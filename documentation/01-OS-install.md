Ubuntu Server Installation (HP EliteDesk Mini PC)
1. Project Context

For this lab environment, Ubuntu Server 22.04 LTS (64-bit) was installed on an HP EliteDesk Mini PC. Ubuntu Server was selected instead of Ubuntu Desktop for the following reasons:
>Lightweight (no graphical user interface)
>CLI-focused environment
>Better suited for logging and security testing
>Aligns with cybersecurity and cloud lab objectives
>Reduced attack surface compared to GUI-based systems
>Ubuntu Server does not include a graphical interface by default, making it ideal for infrastructure and monitoring roles.

2. Download Ubuntu Server ISO

Download the official ISO:Ubuntu Server LTS (64-bit) https://ubuntu.com/download. Always download directly from the official Ubuntu website to ensure integrity.

3. Create a Bootable USB Drive
Requirements: USB flash drive (minimum 8GB) and I used 64GB SanDisk USB used for this installation

Rufus (Windows utility) Download Rufus: https://rufus.ie/en/
Rufus Configuration that I used
Use the following configuration:

>Device: Select USB drive
>Boot Selection: Ubuntu Server ISO
>Partition Scheme: GPT
>Target System: UEFI (non-CSM)
